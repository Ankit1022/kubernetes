#A PersistentVolume (PV) is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or 
#dynamically provisioned using Storage Classes.
#
#A PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is a request for storage by a user. It is similar to a Pod.
#There are two ways PVs may be provisioned: statically or dynamically.
#Static:A cluster administrator creates a number of PVs. They carry the details of the real storage, which is available for use by cluster users.
#Dynamic: This provisioning is based on StorageClasses: the PVC must request a storage class and the administrator must have created 
#and configured that class for dynamic provisioning to occur. 
#
#The reclaim policy for a PersistentVolume tells the cluster what to do with the volume after it has been released of its claim. 
#Currently, volumes can either be Retained, Recycled, or Deleted.
#
#Access Modes:
#ReadWriteOnce
#ReadOnlyMany
#ReadWriteMany
#ReadWriteOncePod
#
#A Kubernetes administrator can specify additional mount options for when a Persistent Volume is mounted on a node.
#awsElasticBlockStore
#azureDisk
#azureFile
#gcePersistentDisk
#nfs,  etc.
